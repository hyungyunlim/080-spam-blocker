"A missed call notification feature that alerts the user when a call has been "
"made to their device / extension but was not answered. This feature "
"typically sends an alert to the user via email, indicating that a call was "
"missed and providing the caller's phone number or contact information. This "
"feature is designed to help users quickly and easily return calls they may "
"have missed."
